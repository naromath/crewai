3. **Dessert: Baklava**

   - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
   - 1 cup maple syrup 
   - 1 cup water 
   - 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
   - Juice of 1 lemon

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Vegetarian Moussaka:**
   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - Salt the eggplant slices and let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat dry.
   - In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Fry the eggplant slices in batches until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.
   - In the same skillet, add the remaining olive oil and sauté the onion until softened. Add garlic and the cooked lentils, cooking until warmed through.
   - Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the mixture thickens.
   - In a separate pot, boil the potato slices until slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
   - In a baking dish, layer half of the potatoes, followed by half of the lentil mixture, and then half of the eggplant. Repeat the layers again, finishing with eggplant on top.
   - Pour béchamel sauce over the top, sprinkle with grated vegan cheese, and bake for 45 minutes until golden and bubbling.

2. **Prepare the Greek Salad:**
   - In a bowl, combine tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, and olives. 
   - In a separate jug, mix olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper. Whisk to emulsify.
   - Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently. Top with crumbled vegan feta and garnish with fresh oregano if desired.

3. **Prepare the Baklava:**
   - Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - In a bowl, mix the chopped nuts, coconut sugar, and cinnamon.
   - Grease a baking dish with coconut oil. Layer 8 sheets of phyllo dough in the dish, brushing each sheet with melted coconut oil. 
   - Spread a thin layer of the nut mixture, then cover with 2 more buttered sheets of phyllo. Repeat the layers until all nuts are used, finishing with 8 layers of phyllo on top.
   - Cut into diamond or square shapes before baking for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.
   - While baking, combine maple syrup, water, vanilla, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Simmer until slightly thickened.
   - Pour the syrup over the baklava as soon as it comes out of the oven and let it cool before serving.

**Serving Suggestions:**
- Serve the vegetarian moussaka warm with a side of Greek salad.
- Allow the baklava to cool and serve it in small squares, garnished with crushed nuts if desired.
- Pair the meal with a glass of ouzo or Greek wine for an authentic dining experience. Enjoy your delicious healthy Greek dinner!

**Explanation of Replaced Ingredients:**
- The minced lamb or beef has been replaced with cooked lentils to provide protein and texture while making the dish plant-based.
- Feta cheese has been substituted with vegan feta cheese to maintain creaminess while adhering to vegetarian standards.
- The butter utilized in the baklava recipe has been substituted with coconut oil to keep it plant-based without compromising the flavor.
- Maple syrup and coconut sugar have been used in place of honey and regular sugar, providing a healthier sweetener option while keeping the richness of the baklava. 

With these modifications, the vegetarian version of Moussaka, Greek Salad, and Baklava remains delicious while being healthy and cruelty-free!
